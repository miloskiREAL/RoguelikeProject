# The Inverted Spire

## Project Description
The Inverted Spire is a roguelike turn-based RPG built using Godot 4.1 and C#. Players control a party of four unique characters as they descend through a mysterious, ever-changing dungeon filled with strategic combat encounters, treasures, and formidable bosses. The game combines classic RPG mechanics with modern roguelike elements to create a challenging and replayable experience.

## Special Features
What sets The Inverted Spire apart is its innovative Wild Card System that fundamentally changes gameplay progression. Unlike traditional RPGs where character growth is linear, players earn powerful cards after each battle that can dramatically alter their abilities and strategies. Combined with the permadeath mechanic that retains some progress while resetting others, this creates a unique risk/reward dynamic where each run feels meaningfully different. The game also features four distinct randomized dungeon layouts and a party-based combat system where each of the four character classes (Knight, Wizard, Monk, Ranger) has specialized roles that encourage tactical thinking and team composition strategy.

## Gameplay Features
- **Turn-Based Combat**: Strategic combat system requiring players to utilize buffs, exploit weaknesses, and manage items effectively
- **Randomized Dungeons**: Four different dungeon layouts ensure each descent offers a fresh experience
- **Diverse Character Classes**: 
  - Knight: Excels at buffs and physical damage
  - Wizard: Wields powerful magical spells
  - Monk: Balances elemental and physical attacks
  - Ranger: Delivers swift, accurate strikes
- **Wild Card System**: Battle rewards that dramatically alter player abilities and are essential for progression
- **Boss Encounters**: Challenging fights that test player strategy and party composition
- **Progressive Permadeath**: Defeat resets wildcards and items but preserves character strength and learned abilities
